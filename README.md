## A Comparative Analysis of Media Types' Impact on Sentiment in the Palestine-Israel Conflict
In today's digital age, where opinions and news travel faster than ever, understanding the
impact of media consumption on public sentiment is crucial, especially in long-standing
geopolitical conflicts. This project delves into the intricate Palestine-Israel conflict, aiming
to uncover how different media types shape public sentiment on this issue. By analyzing a
vast dataset of Reddit comments from various subreddits, we explore the sentiment
embedded within these digital discussions.
Reddit, a platform known for its diverse communities and candid discussions, serves as
an excellent lens to gauge public opinion and emotion. This research will employ
sentiment analysis techniques to dissect the language used in comments aiming to
identify patterns, shifts, and nuances in sentiment across different media types and
sources. By comparing sentiment scores linked to various sources and post types, we
hope to provide insights into how digital media influences public perception and dialogue
around the Palestine-Israel conflict.
